## üßê About Me

Self-taught software developer specializing in JavaScript seeking to pursue my passion and start a new
career in tech. I have been self-learning since the beginning of 2020 and have created several personal
projects to display the skills I have learned. My work ethic is strong, and I'm eager to learn new things. I am very detail-oriented and have excellent problem-solving skills, which allow me to provide high-quality code to help create great products that live up to client expectations. I am also an ambitious, persistent, and responsible person with the ability for individual and team work.
